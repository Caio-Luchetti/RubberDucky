# Troll Mouse script
Malware made to make changes to windows 10 mouse settings!
Inspired by Caleb Hutchinson's Silly Mouse Ducky Payload from hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky, ported to Windows 10 and made better.

# This script does the following:
1. Opens Mouse Properties
2. Switches primary and secondary buttons
3. Changes double-click speed to slow
4. Displays pointer trails
5. Decreases pointer speed to lowest possible setting
6. Increases Vertical Scroll increment to 100 lines

# Inspiration
